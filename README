# N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves placing N queens on an N x N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, the same column, or on the same diagonal.

## Problem Description

The goal is to find all possible configurations of N queens on an N x N chessboard. The queens must be placed in such a way that they cannot attack each other. This problem can be solved using backtracking, a powerful technique for finding solutions to problems by exploring all possible configurations.

## Algorithm

The solution uses a backtracking algorithm that works as follows:

1. Start from the first row and attempt to place a queen in each column.
2. For each column, check if placing a queen is safe (i.e., no other queens threaten this position).
3. If it is safe, place the queen and recursively attempt to place queens in the subsequent rows.
4. If a solution is found, return it. If not, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next column.
5. Repeat until all configurations are explored.

## Code Implementation

The implementation is done in C#. The main components of the program are:

- `CreateBoard(int N)`: Initializes an N x N chessboard.
- `SolveBoard(char[,] board, int row)`: Attempts to solve the board by placing queens row by row.
- `isSafe(char[,] board, int row, int col)`: Checks if a queen can be placed at a given position without being attacked.
- `PrintBoard(char[,] board)`: Displays the current configuration of the board.
